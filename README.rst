CHIME FRB IO
============

File format and support software for CHIME FRB data.

CHIME FRB data has a similar format to CHIME cosmology data and can be read
using the tools in `caput`_, in particular the ``caput.tod`` module. This
package contains additional tools, such as simple file data streamers and a C
interface.
