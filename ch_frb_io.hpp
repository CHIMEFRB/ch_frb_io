// intensity_network_stream: stream object which receives a packet stream from the network.
//
// (Writing a packet stream is handled by a separate class intensity_network_ostream, see below.)
//
// When the intensity_network_stream object is constructed, threads are automatically spawned to read and process
// packets.  The stream presents the incoming data to the "outside world" as a per-beam sequence 
// of regular arrays which are obtained by calling get_assembled_chunk().
//
// Reminder: normal shutdown sequence works as follows.
//  
//   - in network thread, end-of-stream packet is received (in intensity_network_stream::_network_thread_body())
//       - network thread calls intensity_network_stream::_network_thread_exit().
//       - stream state is advanced to 'stream_end_requested', this means that stream has exited but not all threads have joined.
//       - unassembled_ringbuf.end_stream() is called, which will tell the assembler thread that there are no more packets.
//
//   - in assembler thread, unassembled_ringbuf.get_packet_list() returns false.  
//       - the assembler thread loops over all beams ('assemblers') and calls assembled_chunk_ringbuf::end_stream()
//       - this sets assembled_chunk_ringbuf::doneflag
//
//   - in dedispersion thread, assembled_chunk_ringbuf::end_stream() returns an empty pointer.

    //     floating-point arrays (intensity, weights).  Since the packet protocol allows
    //     a boolean mask but not floating-point weights, we simply mask all samples
    //     whose weight is below some cutoff.  This is the 'wt_cutoff' parameter.

    //   - Each UDP packet is a 4D logical array of shape 
    //        (nbeams, nfreq_coarse_per_packet, nupfreq, nt_per_packet).

    //
    //   - If throttle=false, then UDP packets will be written as quickly as possible.
