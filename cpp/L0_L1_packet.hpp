//
// The following pseudo header file isn't actually valid C++ code, but is
// intended to document the L0_L1 UDP packet format in a C++-like syntax.
//
// Here we are specifying the data packet sent from the L0 beam forming process to
// the L1 nodes to search for FRBs.  The characteristics of the system are as follows:
//
//    - Each correlator node (where the L0 process operates) processes all 1024
//      fan-beams for 4 x 390kHz-wide "coarse" frequency bands.  
// 
//    - The L0 process upchannelizes each 390kHz "coarse" frequency band to form 
//      128 x 3.05kHz subbands. In the same process it will dedisperse the data to 
//      a fiducial DM value, then downsample the data to  16 x 24kHz "fine" subbands. 
//
//    - The 4 coarse frequency bands on each correlator node are not currently considered 
//      to be contiguous/consecutive.
//
//    - The amplitude time series for each beam is then squared, polarization summed and 
//      integrated to a 1-ms timescale and stored as uint8. 
//
//    - Each of the 256 correlator nodes will send data packets to each of the frbsearch 
//      nodes (which operate the L1 processes for n beams, currently n=8).
//
//    - The number of time samples per packet is chosen to match the max ethernet packet
//      size (approx 9KB assuming Gbps ethernet with jumbo frames).  For full CHIME,
//      16 time samples per packet is a good choice.
//
//    - Thus each packet contains a 4-dimensional 8-bit array of shape (nbeams, nfreq_coarse, 
//      nupfreq, ntsamp), where:
//
//         nbeams = number of beams processed by each L1 node (currently 8)
//         nfreq_coarse = number of coarse frequencies processed by each L0 node (currently 4)
//         nupfreq = upchannelization channel (currently 16)
//         ntsamp = number of time samples (currently 16)
//
//     - The packets are sent via UDP to the frbsearch node and some fraction may drop along the way.
//
//     - Optionally, the packet may allow for data compression using bitshuffle
//        (https://github.com/kiyo-masui/bitshuffle).
//
// We don't bother putting integer data in network byte order, or converting floating-point data to
// an external representation, since we're assuming that all nodes are Intel CPUs with little-endian
// ints and IEEE 754 floats.
//
// The packet header size in bytes is currently
//    24 + 2*nbeam + 2*nfreq_coarse + 8*nbeam*nfreq
//
// For full CHIME, we expect to use (nbeam, nfreq_coarse, nupfreq, ntsamp) = (8, 4, 16, 16)
// which gives a 304-byte header and an 8192-byte data segment.
//
// For the pathfinder, I'm currently using  (nbeam, nfreq_coarse, nupfreq, ntsamp) = (1, 32, 1, 256) 
// which gives a 346-byte header and an 8192-byte data segment.
//

    // In this version of the protocol, we use assume that they can depend on beam and
    // coarse frequency index, but are the same for each of the 16 upchannelized frequencies
    // comprising a coarse frequency, and are the same for each of the 16 time samples in

    // the ordering will be the same after decompression.
